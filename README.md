IV. Other Libraries

Next step:
Java Faker - This library is used in the tests to generate random data to be passed to the application like user details
Jackson - To read test data from yaml file and load it to DTO class
Lombok - To reduce boilerplate code in DTO classes and increase readabilty
Assertj - To assert the tests. Soft assertions are used where multiple assertions are present so that user can see all passing assertions along with the failed ones
